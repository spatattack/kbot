The mention of Trump is possible but not a primary focus of Fed meetings.  ---  ### KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-MEDI: Will Powell say Median at his Dec 2025 press conference?  **Key Considerations:**   - The term ""median"" is frequently used in discussions about economic data, particularly in relation to measures like the median inflation rate or income. It is likely to come up when discussing economic indicators or projections. - The context in which median values are mentioned will determine the relevance of this term in Powell's remarks.  **Estimated Probability:** 75%   **Recommendation:** YES is underpriced. The Fed often discusses median projections, so a mention is quite likely.  ---  ### KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-GOOD: Will Powell say Good Afternoon at his Dec 2025 press conference?  **Key Considerations:**   - It is customary for the chair of the Federal Reserve to begin their remarks with a greeting. The phrase ""Good Afternoon"" is standard practice. - This is essentially a formality, and Powell is very likely to follow established social norms.  **Estimated Probability:** 90%   **Recommendation:** Fairly priced. It is very likely Powell will commence with a greeting.  ---  ### KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-UNCH: Will Powell say Unchanged at his Dec 2025 press conference?  **Key Considerations:**   - This phrase is commonly used in the context of interest rate decisions or economic assessments. If rates or policies remain the same, it is highly probable Powell will describe any changes as ""unchanged."" - The economic environment and Fed's recent decisions leading up to the conference will heavily influence this.  **Estimated Probability:** 65%   **Recommendation:** YES is underpriced. If there is a period of stability in economic policy, the use of this term is quite likely.  ---  ### KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-DOT: Will Powell say Dot Plot at his Dec 2025 press conference?  **Key Considerations:**   - The ""Dot Plot"" is a key visual and verbal tool used by the Fed to communicate expectations for future interest rate changes among committee members. Its mention is very likely during discussions of monetary policy outlook. - Given the ongoing importance of interest rate projections, it is likely discussed.  **Estimated Probability:** 80%   **Recommendation:** YES is underpriced. Given the construct of the meeting, this term should accordingly be mentioned.  ---  ### KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-PROB: Will Powell say Probability at his Dec 2025 press conference?  **Key Considerations:**   - Powell often discusses the probabilities attached to economic forecasts, uncertainty in projections, and the Fed’s approach to data-driven decision-making. This term might appear in context. - However, it isn't a guaranteed term that will be used regularly.  **Estimated Probability:** 50%   **Recommendation:** Fairly priced. The term ""probability"" is potentially applicable but is less certain than more frequently used terminology.  ---  ### KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-CONS: Will Powell say Consumer Confidence at his Dec 2025 press conference?  **Key Considerations:**   - Consumer confidence is a key economic indicator often referenced during discussions about economic health and forecasts. Given its relevance, especially if it fluctuates, it is likely to be mentioned. - The",Will Powell say Median at his Dec 2025 press conference?,,,,,,,2025-12-11T15:00:00Z,,,,active,,,,95,96,4,5,,,,,35983,,,,,,,,,,,,
