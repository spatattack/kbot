However, it may not be a staple in his rhetoric compared to more traditional topics.  **Estimated Probability:** 55%  **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced.  ---   These estimations and recommendations are based on the political landscape as of October 2023, with trends and prior rhetoric of Donald Trump being significant indicators for the probabilities assigned.","Will Trump say ""Barack Hussein Obama"" before Dec 15, 2025?",,,,,,,2025-12-15T15:00:00Z,,,,active,,,,99,100,0,1,,,,,13513,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approval ratings seem to fluctuate around the mid-40s, indicating a tightly contested political landscape.     2. **Fundamentals**: Trump's political base remains strong, yet key swing states show signs of resistance. Economic indicators and Biden's performance as president also heavily influence voter sentiment, with inflation and economic recovery being major talking points.  3. **News**: Recent developments regarding Trump's legal troubles and the potential impact of his candidacy on GOP unity could affect his chances. The Republican primaries will be crucial in determining Trump's standing heading into the general election.  #### Estimated Probability:  60%  #### Recommendation:  **YES is underpriced**. Given Trump's popularity among Republican voters and historical trends, there is a significant chance he could retain or regain presidential power despite legal challenges and public scrutiny.  ---  In summary, the market reflects a complicated dynamic. The 2024 election will likely be a determining moment for whether Trump can stay in power or be ousted, and factors like polling trends and news cycles should continue to be monitored closely.",Donald Trump out this year?,,,,,,,2026-01-01T04:59:00Z,,,,active,,,,1,1,98,99,,,,,9365377,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given recent trends, if Trump is significantly mentioned in the media and remains a polarizing figure, Powell may reference him in relation to economic policies or political uncertainty.  **Probability:** 30%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced. While Trump may be a topic of discussion, it’s uncertain Powell will specifically mention him in economic contexts.  ---  ### Market: KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-MEDI **Summary:** Median indicators are often discussed in economic press briefings, particularly concerning inflation or growth targets. Powell is likely to refer to median forecasts when discussing economic projections, especially if economic conditions remain stable.  **Probability:** 65%   **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced. Given the historical precedent and current economic indicators, it's reasonable to expect Powell to mention 'median.'  ---  ### Market: KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-GOOD **Summary:** Standard greetings such as “Good Afternoon” are customary in press conferences. It is exceedingly common for Powell to open with a polite greeting, making this a highly likely occurrence.  **Probability:** 90%   **Recommendation:** YES is underpriced. Given the formalities involved in press conferences, this should be nearly certain.  ---  ### Market: KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-DOT **Summary:** The ""dot plot"" is a prominent tool used by the Federal Reserve to communicate future interest rate expectations. Given recent trends towards transparency in Fed communications, Powell is likely to refer to the dot plot more frequently.  **Probability:** 75%   **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced. The probability aligns with past patterns of communication from Powell regarding monetary policy.  ---  ### Market: KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-UNCH **Summary:** The term ""unchanged"" is typically used when discussing interest rates or policy stances that are current and not subject to changes. Depending on the economic conditions leading up to the conference, it is plausible that Powell would declare certain aspects of policy as unchanged.  **Probability:** 60%   **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced. This estimate reflects ongoing uncertainties in economic conditions that could lead to the Fed maintaining its course.  ---  ### Market: KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-CONS **Summary:** Consumer confidence is a crucial indicator of economic health and may be discussed if relevant data is released before the press conference. Given the focus on consumer sentiment in Fed communications, there is a moderate likelihood that Powell will mention it.  **Probability:** 55%   **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced. The odds reflect a balanced outlook on the relevance of consumer confidence as an economic indicator.  ---  ### Market: KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-PROB **Summary:** ""Probability"" is a more general term that Powell may use in the context of economic forecasts or risk assessments but is unlikely to be a focus of discussion compared to other more directly relevant topics.  **Probability:** 40%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced.

Historical patterns show that Presidents tend to make such announcements before major elections to solidify their influence over economic policy. Additionally, a crowded Republican primary could push Trump to act decisively to assert his leadership.  **Estimated Probability:**   70%  **Recommendation:**   YES is underpriced.  ---  ### Market: KXPRESNOMFEDCHAIR-25-DEC6 **Key Considerations:**   Given the timing of this specific date, the market is likely reacting to the buildup of political pressure leading up to a pivotal moment within the primary calendar. Trump's need to consolidate his position may encourage him to announce a nominee around this time, as it also aligns with opportune media coverage in December post-election primaries.  **Estimated Probability:**   65%  **Recommendation:**   YES is slightly underpriced.  ---  ### Market: KXPRESNOMFEDCHAIR-25-DEC20 **Key Considerations:**   This date falls in the middle of the holiday season when political news often slows down. However, if Trump wishes to galvanize economic discussions in advance of the new year, this could be a strategic timeframe for him. The chances hinge largely on the outcomes of the early primary contests occurring in early 2025.  **Estimated Probability:**   60%  **Recommendation:**   Yas is fairly priced.  ---  ### Market: KXPRESNOMFEDCHAIR-25-DEC13 **Key Considerations:**   The December timeline remains crucial, similar to the above, but trends within polling toward the end of the year will heavily influence any announcements. If Trump is enjoying favorable polling against his Republican challengers, he may choose to capitalize on this momentum with an announcement, making December 13 a viable date.  **Estimated Probability:**   68%  **Recommendation:**   YES is underpriced.  ---  ### Market: KXPRESNOMFEDCHAIR-25-26FEB **Key Considerations:**   Moving into February 2026, the dynamics shift now to a new election year context, where Trump's strategies may evolve depending on previous announcements and polling. Announcing in February could also be tied to power plays within Congress while the new administration sorts through economic policies with implications for a Fed Chair.  **Estimated Probability:**   40%  **Recommendation:**   NO is underpriced.  ---  ### Market: KXPRESNOMFEDCHAIR-25-26JAN15 **Key Considerations:**   This date is early in 2026, which the Trump team may view as a critical opportunity to set the narrative around economic policy as they move into an election season. However, with a Federal Reserve Chair typically being announced closer to the end of a term or tenure, the chances here are reduced given the complexity of the economic landscape in January.  **Estimated Probability:**   35%  **Recommendation:**   NO is highly underpriced.",Will Trump announce his new Chair of the Federal Reserve in 2025?,,,,,,,2025-12-13T04:59:00Z,,,,active,,,,2,3,97,98,,,,,56791,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent polls suggest that fiscal conservatism is a priority for many voters within the Republican base, which could push for some minor cuts.  **Estimated Probability**: 70%   **Recommendation**: YES is underpriced.  ---  ## Market: KXGOVTCUTS-25-25 **Summary**: A reduction of $25 billion in spending seems more plausible, especially with the current political pressures on budget management. Trump's administration may face challenges, but there is historical precedence for reduced spending in Republican-led administrations.  **Estimated Probability**: 60%   **Recommendation**: YES is fairly priced.  ---  ## Market: KXGOVTCUTS-25-100 **Summary**: A $100 billion cut would require more substantial commitment and negotiation within Congress. The bipartisan nature of government budgeting makes this scenario less likely, as stakeholders from both sides may resist significant cuts.  **Estimated Probability**: 45%   **Recommendation**: NO is underpriced.  ---  ## Market: KXGOVTCUTS-25-250 **Summary**: Cutting government spending by $250 billion would significantly shift fiscal policy and likely meet strong resistance, even from within Trump's party.
