However, both leaders recognize the importance of U.S.-Canada relations. Recent discussions have been seen following the U.S. midterms, and potential future collaborations could lead to a meeting.   **Estimated Probability:** 40%   **Recommendation:** YES is underpriced.  ---  ### Market: KXWLEADER-25-KJU **Summary:** The relationship between Trump and Kim Jong-Un has been marked by both hostility and moments of diplomacy. Given the lack of high-level engagement since their last meeting, the potential for a meeting hinges largely on North Korea's strategic goals. Additionally, Kim might prefer to engage with a different U.S. administration unless there’s a dramatic shift.  **Estimated Probability:** 25%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced.  ---  ### Market: KXWLEADER-25-XJIN **Summary:** Relations between Trump and Xi Jinping have been characterized by competitive tension, particularly regarding trade and technology. Trump's potential return to office might affect the dynamics, but given the geopolitical landscape and the ongoing focus on competition with China, a meeting remains unlikely unless a significant policy shift occurs.  **Estimated Probability:** 20%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced.  ---  ### Market: KXWLEADER-25-VP **Summary:** Trump and Putin's relationship has seen both cooperation and tension, particularly regarding U.S. foreign policy and military engagements. Given the current state of international relations and conflict in Ukraine, a formal meeting may depend on the evolving geopolitical landscape. However, a meeting before 2026 remains plausible with strategic interests aligning.  **Estimated Probability:** 60%   **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced.  ---  ### Market: KXWLEADER-25-NMAD **Summary:** Nicolás Maduro and Trump represent starkly different political ideologies and strategies regarding Venezuela. While Trump historically has taken a hard stance against Maduro, shifts in U.S. foreign policy could create scenarios for dialogue. However, current relations are fraught, making a meeting unlikely.  **Estimated Probability:** 15%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced.  ---  ### Market: KXWLEADER-25-MCAR **Summary:** Mark Carney’s past involvement in international finance could present opportunities for collaboration, especially in economic discussions. However, Carney is more of a financial professional than a political leader, and the likelihood of a direct meeting with Trump seems low unless framed as part of a broader economic dialogue.  **Estimated Probability:** 30%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced.  ---  ### Market: KXWLEADER-25-MBS **Summary:** Mohammed bin Salman has been eager to strengthen ties with the U.S., particularly under the Trump administration, which previously favored him. Given the focus on energy stability and geopolitical cooperation in the Middle East, a meeting seems plausible. However, implications from the Khashoggi case and other regional tensions could complicate the dynamics.  **Estimated Probability:** 55%   **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced.",Will Trump meet with Kim Jong-Un before 2025?,,,,,,,2026-01-01T15:00:00Z,,,,active,,,,2,3,97,98,,,,,700050,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current economic data shows persistent inflation, which might prompt a change in leadership if the public or political leaders lose confidence in Powell's strategies. Additionally, potential contenders for his role might emerge depending on shifts in administration support or Congress's composition.    **Estimated Probability:** 60%    **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced. The market seems to reflect a plausible scenario where Powell could depart due to a combination of persistent economic challenges and political dynamics.    ---  ### Market: LEAVEPOWELL-25-AUG31   **Summary:** With a timeline set for August 2025, considerations include the economic landscape leading into the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and any upcoming political events, like pivotal elections. Given Powell's four-year term is under scrutiny with inflationary pressures, there’s a reasonable chance he could step down or not be reappointed if circumstances do not improve.     **Estimated Probability:** 45%    **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced. The likelihood of Powell leaving by this date appears low, given the usual duration of Fed Chairs’ terms unless extraordinary circumstances occur.    ---  ### Market: LEAVEPOWELL-25-JUL31   **Summary:** Similar to the August 2025 market, this market also reflects the near-term expectations for Powell's leadership. However, given that July precedes key decision-making periods for the Fed, it may be influenced by immediate economic conditions and legislative outcomes. The earlier July date suggests a slightly diminished probability given the time it allows for changes in chairman position.    **Estimated Probability:** 40%    **Recommendation:** NO is fairly priced. The anticipation of a leadership change in such a condensed time frame is ambitious unless triggered by major economic or political disruptors.     ---  ### Market: LEAVEPOWELL-25-26APR30   **Summary:** By this date, the speculation may focus on the longer-term implications of monetary policy and economic conditions. Should Powell stay until this point, patterns from prior leadership transitions suggest he would likely continue if economic conditions stabilize and if political winds remain favorable.    **Estimated Probability:** 30%    **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced. The longer timeframe significantly reduces the likelihood of his departure, given institutional stability in the Fed and potential for ongoing economic recovery strategies.    ---  ### Market: LEAVEPOWELL-25-NOV30   **Summary:** This market targets a date similarly close to the end of 2025, which could be a pivotal time for Powell depending on the Fed's handling of ongoing inflation and employment goals. Any potential resignation would likely be influenced by political pressure and economic performance leading up to November.    **Estimated Probability:** 50%    **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced. A balanced view of Powell's potential exit aligns with expectations of economic fluctuations, increasing or diminishing his chances of maintaining the position.    ---  ### Market: LEAVEPOWELL-25-OCT31   **Summary:** The timeline here aligns closely with critical fiscal discussions and potential shifts leading into the next election cycle. The sentiment surrounding Powell's decision-making and the economic climate influences this outcome. If major policy decisions or poor economic indicators arise, they may initiate early discussions around leadership change.    **Estimated Probability:** 55%    **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced. The October deadline allows for significant shifts in sentiment, making a possible resignation plausible based on evolving economic pressures and political considerations.",Powell leaves before 2026?,,,,,,,2026-01-01T04:59:00Z,,,,active,,,,2,3,97,98,,,,,6329051,,,,,,,,,,,,
