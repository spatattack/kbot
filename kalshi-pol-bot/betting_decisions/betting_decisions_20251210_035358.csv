By 2026, he might be involved in political campaigns, which could limit his free time to attend games. - **Media Attention**: Trump often garners media coverage when attending public events, making it likely he would attend a football game if the situation arises. - **Cultural Influence**: Football is a major part of American culture, and Trump's affinity for high-profile events would suggest he might attend.  #### Estimated Probability **Probability that YES resolves as true**: 70%  #### Recommendation **Recommendation**: YES is fairly priced.

High likelihood for standard phrases and economic terms, while references to political figures or less common terms hold lower probabilities.","### Market Analysis for KXFEDMENTION-25DEC  #### 1. KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-TRUM: Will Powell say Trump at his Dec 2025 press conference? - **Key Considerations**: As of now, the Federal Reserve's primary focus remains on monetary policy, inflation control, and economic conditions. Current political climate includes discussions around Trump due to his position in the Republican Party, but it's less likely that Powell would comment on a politically charged subject unless it's directly relevant to economic policies. - **Estimated Probability**: 20% - **Recommendation**: **NO is underpriced.** It's unlikely Powell will mention Trump, making a YES bet a riskier choice.  #### 2. KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-MEDI: Will Powell say Median at his Dec 2025 press conference? - **Key Considerations**: Median is often referenced in discussions about inflation targets, interest rates, and forecasts. Given Powell's focus on data-driven policy, there's a high likelihood that he will mention median rates or median forecasts. - **Estimated Probability**: 75% - **Recommendation**: **YES is fairly priced.** There is reasonable expectation for median references in economic forecasts.  #### 3. KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-GOOD: Will Powell say Good Afternoon at his Dec 2025 press conference? - **Key Considerations**: Standard etiquette dictates an opening greeting at press conferences, making it highly probable that Powell will include a greeting such as ""Good Afternoon."" - **Estimated Probability**: 95% - **Recommendation**: **YES is fairly priced.** The odds are strongly in favor of Powell delivering a greeting.  #### 4. KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-DOT: Will Powell say Dot Plot at his Dec 2025 press conference? - **Key Considerations**: The Dot Plot is a key element of the Fed's communication regarding interest rate projections. Given Powell's typically detailed and technical discussions, mentioning the Dot Plot, especially in a context of guiding future policy, is likely. - **Estimated Probability**: 80% - **Recommendation**: **YES is fairly priced.** Strong prospects for this term being used.  #### 5. KXFEDMENTION-25DEC-UNCH: Will Powell say Unchanged at his Dec 2025 press conference? - **Key Considerations**: If there have been no changes in monetary policy during the preceding months, the word 'unchanged' is often used to describe current interest rates or policy stances. This depends heavily on the economic context leading up to the meeting. - **Estimated Probability**: 65% - **Recommendation**: **YES is somewhat underpriced.** Given the unpredictability of economic conditions leading up to the conference, a mention of unchanged policies is plausible.  #### 6.

Current sentiment towards inflation control and economic growth, alongside political pressures, indicate that a standstill on rates could be possible even if fears or differing views within the Fed about economic outlooks exist. Recent comments from Fed members suggest sensitivity towards maintaining rates depending on economic conditions, but also highlight the reality of divergent opinions.  **Estimated Probability:** 50%  **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced. The scenario of no rate change and some dissents is plausible, thus reflecting a balanced expectation based on the current economic trajectory.  ---  ### Market: KXFEDCOMBO-25DEC-0-0 **Summary:** This market evaluates the possibility of no change in the federal funds rate coupled with zero dissents. Given the historical context and potential economic conditions leading up to December 2025, there is a strong likelihood of divergent views among Fed members due to differing forecasts and economic indicators. Previous instances of stability in the funds rate have usually encountered some degree of dissent, detracting from the likelihood of this scenario.  **Estimated Probability:** 20%  **Recommendation:** YES is underpriced. Given the likelihood of dissents reflecting varied economic assessments, this market scenario's projected probability seems too high, making a position favoring it less attractive."

There are arguments both for and against the tariffs in terms of job creation, inflation, and international relations. - **Public Opinion:** While public sentiment can shift, polling around tariffs and Trump's economic policies could provide some indicators about the Court's inclination to side with Trump.  **Estimated Probability:** 55%   **Recommendation:** Fairly priced  ### Summary: The market surrounding whether the Supreme Court will rule in favor of Trump's tariffs is influenced by various factors, including legal precedents, political context, economic implications, and public opinion.

Inflation is trending down, but employment growth remains robust. The Federal Reserve's actions will largely depend on inflation trends and economic growth rates moving into 2025.    2. **Federal Reserve's Stated Goals**: The Fed has been clear about its commitment to controlling inflation. A cut of more than 25 basis points (bps) suggests a more aggressive monetary policy response due to significant economic deterioration or a dramatic decline in inflation expectations.  3. **Market Sentiment**: Currently, financial markets reflect some anticipation of rate cuts, but a large cut (greater than 25 bps) would indicate underlying economic weakness. Various analysts speculate that the Fed may stay cautious and conservative unless a drastic economic downturn occurs.  4. **External Factors**: Global economic conditions in 2025, including geopolitical tensions, trade policies, and the response of international markets, will also play critical roles in influencing the Fed's decision-making process.  #### Estimated Probability: **YES Probability:** 30%  #### Recommendation: **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced. Given the current economic indicators and the Federal Reserve's cautious approach towards rate adjustments, a cut of more than 25 basis points appears less likely unless severe economic challenges arise unexpectedly."

(Dec 9, 2025)  ---  #### Market: KXELECTIONMOVABQ-25DEC09-P12 **Summary:**   To win between 10% and 14.99% of the votes, Tim Keller must be viewed as a competitive candidate but not necessarily the front-runner. Current polling indicates he is favored, but not overwhelmingly so, and potential challengers are gaining momentum, which complicates his position. Local sentiment toward his administration and issues like crime and economic recovery will also play critical roles.  **Estimated Probability:** 30%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced. Keller's chances of winning in this range seem low based on current sentiment.  ---  #### Market: KXELECTIONMOVABQ-25DEC09-P17 **Summary:**   Winning between 15% and 19.99% signifies a more solid position for Keller. However, considering projected voter turnout and shifting demographics, this range may be where he expects to land if he faces a closer race. Current trends suggest a competitive runoff, yet Keller's past performance and controversies could hinder him.  **Estimated Probability:** 25%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced. While Keller has a chance, it appears insufficient to justify higher probabilities in this range.  ---  #### Market: KXELECTIONMOVABQ-25DEC09-P22 **Summary:**   This market reflects Keller winning between 20% and 24.99%. For Keller to secure this range, he would need to capitalize on voter discontent with his opponent and increase support from key demographics. The likelihood of significant support here remains moderate, based on surveys.  **Estimated Probability:** 20%   **Recommendation:** Fairly priced. This range seems plausible but still indicates he has challenges ahead.  ---  #### Market: KXELECTIONMOVABQ-25DEC09-P7 **Summary:**   If Keller wins between 5% and 9.99%, it would reflect a significant loss and possible backlash against his policy decisions. Such an outcome would require a major turnout shift against him, which isn’t currently the trend suggested by polling.  **Estimated Probability:** 10%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced. This range appears too low given current expectations.  ---  #### Market: KXELECTIONMOVABQ-25DEC09-P2 **Summary:**   Keller winning between 0% and 4.99% would signify an almost catastrophic failure. While this scenario is conceivable if there is a significant voter revolt, it lacks substantial backing in the current political climate.  **Estimated Probability:** 5%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced. Current polling does not suggest such a drastic loss.  ---  #### Market: KXELECTIONMOVABQ-25DEC09-P27 **Summary:**   For Keller to win between 25% and 29.99% of the votes, he would likely have to run a strong campaign, leveraging existing support. This range suggests he could still be in contention for a solid victory, marking a meaningful improvement over earlier margins.  **Estimated Probability:** 15%   **Recommendation:** Fairly priced. This is plausible but still uncertain amid competing candidates.  ---  #### Market: KXELECTIONMOVABQ-25DEC09-P72 **Summary:**   Winning between 45% and 100% of votes indicates a resounding victory. Given the competitive nature of the Albuquerque elections, this range would be possible but implies a strong consolidation of support around Keller.  **Estimated Probability:** 10%   **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced. This requires a very strong campaign and robust voter turnout that seems unlikely at this juncture.  ---   ### Conclusion  Based on the assessment of each market, there is a significant degree of uncertainty surrounding Keller’s likelihood of winning various vote margins in the upcoming mayoral runoff.

Looking at the historical price movements and the projected energy demand, the average gas price may linger around the $3 mark, factoring in peak travel seasons and economic recovery post-pandemic. 2. **Estimated Probability**: 60% 3. **Recommendation**: YES is fairly priced.  ### Market: KXAAAGASM-25DEC31-2.90 1. **Key Considerations**: Given that gas prices in 2023 are already fluctuating around the $3 mark, and considering historical data for the preceding years, a price above $2.90 seems likely. Factors such as market demand, crude oil prices, and seasonal variations are important here as well, but the general trend suggests a stronger probability for prices remaining above this threshold. 2. **Estimated Probability**: 75% 3. **Recommendation**: YES is underpriced.  ### Market: KXAAAGASM-25DEC31-2.85 1. **Key Considerations**: Trends in gas prices have shown that even during downturns, prices typically do not fall below the $3 mark unless there are significant economic disruptions or shifts in energy policy. Current economic indicators suggest a steady demand for gas, particularly with recovery in transportation and industrial sectors, making it reasonable to expect the prices to stay comfortably above this mark. 2. **Estimated Probability**: 85% 3. **Recommendation**: YES is underpriced.  ### Market: KXAAAGASM-25DEC31-3.00 1. **Key Considerations**: The threshold of $3.00 correlates tightly with both current trends and projections for consumer demand. While there are fluctuations based on crude oil prices and socio-economic factors, gas prices have historically remained resilient above this level, particularly in holiday seasons when demand spikes. Geo-economic factors may impact this, but the trend for demand points towards maintaining prices above $3.00. 2. **Estimated Probability**: 70% 3. **Recommendation**: YES is fairly priced.  ### Market: KXAAAGASM-25DEC31-3.05 1. **Key Considerations**: Estimates from analysts on future oil prices suggest that maintaining gas prices above $3.05 will be highly dependent on OPEC decisions and domestic production levels. While the average currently trends above this level, it is subject to increasing volatility with global economic conditions. The energy transition and changes in consumer behavior could narrow the price margin in the future, but expectations remain that $3.05 can be sustained. 2. **Estimated Probability**: 55% 3. **Recommendation**: NO is underpriced.  ### Market: KXAAAGASM-25DEC31-2.80 1. **Key Considerations**: Given the current price trajectory and demand forecasts, prices above $2.80 appear reasonable due to consistent consumer demand and a recovering economy. With inflationary pressures and global supply chain issues, prices can sustain higher levels, especially through seasonal increases in demand. This makes it very likely that average prices will exceed this figure by the end of 2025. 2. **Estimated Probability**: 90% 3. **Recommendation**: YES is underpriced.  ### Market: KXAAAGASM-25DEC31-3.10 1. **Key Considerations**: The forecast surrounding this price point hinges on potential spikes due to geopolitical unrest or significant production cuts. However, considering historical data and gas market behavior, breaching the $3.10 mark could indicate strong demand or inflation, both of which are plausible scenarios.

Though there have been signs of improved relations recently, both leaders have divergent political agendas. Upcoming elections in Canada and the United States may also complicate a potential meeting.    2. **Estimated Probability:** 40%  3. **Recommendation:** YES is underpriced.

North Korea remains a central issue in U.S. foreign policy, but recent developments indicate a more hostile environment, making another meeting less likely.    2. **Estimated Probability:** 20%  3. **Recommendation:** NO is underpriced.
