His closeness to Trump and prior experience at a high level in government positions him well. However, there is no current strong push from Trump or significant news indicating Hassett is an imminent nominee.   **Estimated Probability:** 25%   **Recommendation:** YES is overpriced. The lack of recent support for Hassett’s nomination suggests that he’s less likely to be picked compared to other contenders.  ---  ### Market: KXFEDCHAIRNOM-29-CWAL **Nominee:** Christopher Waller   **Key Considerations:** Christopher Waller is currently a member of the Federal Reserve Board, giving him significant credibility and recognition. His reelection to the Fed Board implies stability, and being an incumbent could work in his favor. However, his association with the Fed’s current policies might deter Trump from making such a choice amid potential criticism of the Fed.   **Estimated Probability:** 35%   **Recommendation:** YES is fairly priced.
